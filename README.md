## Supported Operations

### Arithmetic Operations
- **Addition (+):** Add two numbers.
- **Subtraction (-):** Subtract the second number from the first.
- **Multiplication (*):** Multiply two numbers.
- **Division (/):** Divide the first number by the second.
- **Modulo (mod):** Calculate the remainder of division.

### Advanced Operations
- **Square (xÂ²):** Square a given number.
- **Reciprocal (1/x):** Find the reciprocal of a number.

### Memory Operations
- **M+ (Memory Add):** Add the current value to memory.
- **M- (Memory Subtract):** Subtract the current value from memory.
- **MS (Memory Store):** Store the current value in memory.
- **MC (Memory Clear):** Clear the stored memory value (enabled only when memory is non-zero).
- **MR (Memory Recall):** Recall the stored memory value (enabled only when memory is non-zero).

## Example Usage
1. Input the desired operation symbol (e.g., `+`, `-`, etc.).
2. Provide the necessary inputs for the operation.
3. Press calculate to see the result.

## Notes
- **Division by zero** or **wrong expressions** will result in an error during evaluation, and an appropriate error message will be displayed.
- Results for floating-point operations will display up to **two decimal places** for clarity.
- **MC** and **MR** are only enabled when the memory value is not zero.
- Ensure all inputs are valid numbers.
